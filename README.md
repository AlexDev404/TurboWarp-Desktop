The Speedy TurboWarp Scratch Mod as a Desktop Application Wrapped in [Electron][2] using [Nativefier][3]

Ever wanted TurboWarp as a Desktop app just like how MIT's Scratch has their own? Well now TurboWarp Desktop is here!
Just download and install to start creating!

# How do I Download it?

Go over to [Releases][1] and click the installer to download.

# What is the difference?

TurboWarp Desktop is the same as turbowarp.org except this time you can work offline and do not 
need an active internet connection to start creating or editing your favorite projects.

# What Platforms can this work on?

Right now the only supported platform is Windows unfortunately.
We will add support to Android and MacOS in the near future.
